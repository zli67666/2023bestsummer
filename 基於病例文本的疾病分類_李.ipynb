A left retrocardiac opacity remains unchanged , reflecting either atelectasis focal consolidation . There pneumothorax .'\n 'TYPE OF EXAMINATION : Chest PA lateral . INDICATION : -year-old female patient shortness breath , evaluate CHF . FINDINGS : PA lateral chest views obtained patient upright position . Analysis performed direct comparison next preceding similar study . Mild-to-moderate cardiac enlargement present different size comparison previous study . Unchanged appearance mildly widened elongated heavily wall calcified thoracic aorta . No suspicion new aneurysmatic formations . The pulmonary vasculature congested lateral posterior pleural sinuses remain free fluid accumulation . Lateral view demonstrates accentuated kyphotic curvature demineralized thoracic spine least two wedge compressed vertebral bodies , similar seen previous examinations . IMPRESSION : Stable chest findings , mild-to-moderate cardiac enlargement elderly patient , evidence acute pulmonary congestion pulmonary edema . No acute new parenchymal infiltrates .'\n \"EXAMINATION : CHEST ( AP AND LAT ) INDICATION : History : M confusion per family TECHNIQUE : Upright AP lateral views chest COMPARISON : Chest radiograph FINDINGS : Assessment lung apices somewhat limited patient 's neck chin projecting areas . A left-sided pacer device noted leads terminating right atrium right ventricle . Moderate cardiomegaly re- demonstrated left ventricular predominance . The aorta diffusely calcified tortuous . Mediastinal hilar contours unchanged . The pulmonary vasculature engorged . Patchy opacities demonstrated within right lung base , along streaky retrocardiac opacity . No pleural effusion pneumothorax clearly noted . Moderate severe degenerative changes thoracic spine present along chronic compression deformity mid thoracic vertebral body . IMPRESSION : Limited assessment lung apices . Patchy opacities right lung base may reflect infection aspiration correct clinical setting . Streaky retrocardiac atelectasis .\"\n 'INDICATION : Cough shortness breath . COMPARISON : Chest radiograph . FINDINGS : PA lateral views chest reviewed . Compared recent prior , increased interstitial markings , diffuse parenchymal opacities hazziness pulmonary vessels indicates worsening moderate pulmonary edema . Mild cardiomegaly tortuous aorta unchanged . There pleural effusion pneumothorax . Mild degenerative changes thoracic spine unchanged . IMPRESSION : Worsening moderate pulmonary edema . Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly .'\n 'EXAMINATION : CHEST ( PA AND LAT ) INDICATION : year old man productive cough x 3 weeks // ? pneumonia ? pneumonia IMPRESSION : In comparison study , moderate enlargement cardiac silhouette without vascular congestion , pleural effusion , acute focal pneumonia . Intact midline sternal wires cervical fusion device seen .'\n 'CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON COMPARISON : Prior exam . CLINICAL HISTORY : Shortness breath , question pneumonia pulmonary edema . FINDINGS : PA lateral views chest provided . Tripolar pacer unchanged leads extending region right atrium , right ventricle coronary sinus . The heart mildly enlarged . There pulmonary vascular congestion new prior exam . The lungs appear clear without definite signs pneumonia alveolar edema . Right CP angle excluded . No pneumothorax . Mediastinal contour stable . Bony structures intact . IMPRESSION : Cardiomegaly central pulmonary congestion .'\n 'REASON FOR EXAMINATION : Dyspnea , evaluation patient ERCP . Portable AP radiograph chest reviewed comparison . There mild interstitial pulmonary edema , grossly unchanged since prior study . Left retrocardiac opacity appears unchanged , interval progression right basal opacity . Small bilateral pleural effusion present . No pneumothorax seen . IMPRESSION : Slight interval progression left retrocardiac consolidation interstitial pulmonary edema .'\n 'EXAMINATION : CHEST ( PA AND LAT ) INDICATION : year old man s/p BKA new asterixis tremor // ? infectious process COMPARISON : IMPRESSION : As compared previous radiograph , relevant change seen . Sternotomy wires unchanged position . Status post CABG . Moderate cardiomegaly without overt pulmonary edema . Minimal right pleural effusion . No evidence pneumonia acute lung disease .'\n 'PORTABLE CHEST , COMPARISON : Radiograph one day earlier . FINDINGS : Indwelling support monitoring devices standard position . Stable cardiomegaly accompanied pulmonary vascular congestion worsening pulmonary edema well enlarging pleural effusions , moderate size bilaterally .'].\nReshape your data either using array.reshape(-1, 1) if your data has a single feature or array.reshape(1, -1) if it contains a single sample."
